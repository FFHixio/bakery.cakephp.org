CakePHP 3.7.0-RC3 Released
============================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.7.0-RC3. This is the release candidate for 3.7.0, and it contains several
new major features. If no major issues are reported a stable release will be
packaged in a few weeks.

3.7 is the **last** planned minor release of CakePHP 3.x before 4.0 is released.
Once 4.0 is released, 2.x will only receive security fixes, and 3.x will only
continue to receive bug & security fix releases. If there is significant
community interest there may be a 3.8 release, but there are no plans at this
point in time.

Updating to the RC
------------------

You can use composer to upgrade to the beta version of CakePHP 3.7.0::

    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:3.7.0-RC3"

We would greatly appreciate it if you temporarily upgraded your application, and
ran your tests. By opening issues for any regressions in the release candidate,
we can help ensure a smoother release of 3.7.0 before the stable release.

What's new in 3.7.0?
--------------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/3.next/en/appendices/3-7-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 3.7.0, and what has been deprecated. We
recommend you give that page a read when upgrading.

Changes since 3.7.0-RC2
-------------------------

* ``Validator::allowEmpty()`` is now deprecated. While simple to use this method
  would allow incorrectly typed 'empty' data in. In its place four new methods
  have been added that are more explicit about the accepted empty data.
* Improved API documentation.
* Chained exceptions now include stack traces in log files for the inner 
  exceptions.
* ``ArrayCache`` was added as an engine for Cache. This allows you to store
  cache data only until the end of the current process.
* Improve display paths in console environments.
* ``NullEngine::write()`` method will now return ``true``, this in effect will
  comply with parent abstract method's return type declaration.
