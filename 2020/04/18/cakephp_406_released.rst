CakePHP 4.0.6 Released
===============================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
4.0.6. This is a maintenance release for the 4.0 branch that fixes several
community reported issues and a low risk security issue in our CSRF protection
middleware.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 4.0.6. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/4.0.5...4.0.6>`_ for every commit.

* Nirmal Kirubakaran contacted us via the security mailing list and disclosed a
  vulnerability in our CSRF token generation. If an attacker were to use an XSS
  vulnerabiity or physical access to fixate a CSRF token they could then exploit
  additional CSRF attacks. In this release tokens contain an HMAC signed with
  ``Security.salt``. This ensures the tokens were generated by the same
  application that receives them.
* Improved session access in ``IntegrationTestTrait`` through the new
  ``getTestSession()`` method.
* Fixed generation of pagination links on ``/`` URLs.
* ``cake plugin unload`` and ``cake plugin load`` now handle vendor namespaced
  plugins.
* ``Validation::inList()`` no longer emits a warning on a non-scalar values.
* Schema reflection stored procedures in SQLServer now work in case sensitive
  configurations.
* Email message wrapping no longer emits errors when lines are the same length
  as the wrap length.
* ``App::path()`` now resolves locale files for plugins.
