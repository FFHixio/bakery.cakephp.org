Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 4.0.5. See the `changelog

* SMTP delivery failure exceptions now include the error text received from the
  destination server.
* Improved API documentation.
* ``Table::saveMany()`` now correctly rollbacks a transaction when an entity
  other than the first fails to save because of application rules or database
  failure.
* ``ConsoleIntegrationTestTrait`` now uses mocked ``_out`` and ``_err`` objects
  if they have been set.
* ``ConsoleInput::read()`` now handles ``false`` values from ``fgets()`` and
  readline.
* ``CounterCacheBehavior`` now handles null association values better when
  custom finders are used.
* ``Http\Response`` now allows usage of unassigned HTTP status codes between 100
  and 599.
