CakePHP 4.1.0-RC1 Released
============================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the first release candidate of CakePHP
4.1.0. This beta introduces a handful of deprecations. It also adds window
function support and common-table-expression support to the ORM. Furthermore, 
it features improved ``debug()`` output, and new ORM events for marshalling.

New Features
------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/4.next/en/appendices/4-1-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 4.1.0. We recommend you give that page a read
when upgrading as it outlines the deprecations present in 4.1.

Changes Since 4.1.0-beta1
-------------------------

* ``Form\Form::set()`` was added to help incrementally update the data in a Form
  object.
* The interface for CommonTableExpressions and windowing functions were
  improved.
* ``TranslateBehavior`` now supports a ``locale`` option when finding records.
  This option lets you set the locale for a single find call.
* ``Query::clearResult()`` was added to clear the internal result and count
  value.
* Deprecation annotations now contain IDE clickable links.
* Added missing annotations in the Validation package.
* Datetime inputs created through ``FormHelper`` can have the ``step`` option
  unset.
* Cache adapters that require extensions now raise clearer exceptions when the
  required extensions are missing.
* ``Datasource\LocatorInterface`` was added to help easy other locator
  implementations.
* ``SmtpAdapter`` now supports ``AUTH PLAIN``.
* PHP8 nightly builds were added to the CakePHP test matrix.
* Delete operations with cascading callbacks now abort when an associated record
  fails to delete because of application rule failures.
* ``Query::orderAsc()`` and ``Query::orderDesc()`` now support closures to build
  the order clause.
* ``Session::read()`` now has a default parameter.
* ``Session::readOrFail()`` was added.
