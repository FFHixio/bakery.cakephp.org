CakePHP 4.1.0-beta1 Released
============================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the first beta release of CakePHP
4.1.0. This beta introduces a handful of deprecations. It also adds window
function support and common-table-expression support to the ORM. Furthermore, 
it features improved ``debug()`` output, and new ORM events for marshalling.

New Features
------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/4.next/en/appendices/4-1-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 4.1.0. We recommend you give that page a read
when upgrading as it outlines the deprecations present in 4.1.

How you Can Help
----------------

You can help by trying out the beta in your application. Please open issues for
any new test failures or regressions the new version creates in your
application.
