CakePHP 4.2.0-beta1 Released
============================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the first beta release of CakePHP
4.2.0. This beta introduces a small number of deprecations. It adds experimental
support for a dependency injection container, a session based CSRF option, and
improved support for subqueries.

New Features
------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/4.next/en/appendices/4-2-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 4.2.0. We recommend you give that page a read
when upgrading as it outlines the deprecations present in 4.2.

How you Can Help
----------------

You can help by trying out the beta in your application. Please open issues for
any new test failures or regressions the new version creates in your
application.
