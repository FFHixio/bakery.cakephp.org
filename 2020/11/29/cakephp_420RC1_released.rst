CakePHP 4.2.0-RC1 Released
==========================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the first release candidate of
CakePHP 4.2.0. The 4.2.0 release will introduce several new features and
a handful of deprecations. The added features include formal support for PHP8,
experimental support for a dependency injection container, a new session
based CSRF middleware, improved APIs for database subqueries, and a new Flash
Utility.

New Features
------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/4.next/en/appendices/4-2-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 4.2.0. We recommend you give that page a read
when upgrading as it outlines the deprecations present in 4.2.

Changes Since 4.2.0-beta1
-------------------------

* ``Http\Client::createFromUrl()`` was added.
* Improved errors when ``INSERT`` queries cannot be compiled.
* ``TableHelper::output()`` now has a ``text-right`` tag to right align
  cell content.
* ``TestFixture::isManaged()`` was added to make whether a fixture manages
  schema more explicit.
* ``UrlHelper`` now supports the ``assetUrlClassName`` option, which allows you
  to replace the class used to generate static asset URLs.
* ``TableLocator::allowFallbackClass()`` was added. This method lets you disable
  automatic fallback table class in a locator.
* ``Http\FlashMessage`` was added. This utility class enables flash messages to
  be manipulated from within middleware.
* ``Http\ServerRequest::getFlash()`` was added to expose the new flash utility.
* Fixing binding conflicts in SQLServer queries.
* Added ``Application.buildContainer`` event. This event is triggered when the
  application container is built.
* Integration test traits had the ``mockService()`` method added to enable
  straightforward mocking of services in tests.
