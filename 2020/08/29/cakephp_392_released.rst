===============================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.9.2. This is a maintenance release for the 3.9 branch that fixes several
community reported issues.

* The ``Http\Client`` curl adapter now uses ``CURLOPT_NOBODY`` when making HEAD
  requests.
