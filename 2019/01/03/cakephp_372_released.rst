  use spaces in the command name.

* Error pages for parsed extensions are once again rendering correctly.
* A redundant expiry time check in ``FileEngine`` was removed.
* ``RequestHandlerComponent`` once again handles explicit htm and html
  extensions correctly.
* ``UrlHelper::assetUrl()`` now supports a ``fullBase`` option enabling CDN
  assets to be linked more easily.
* The database package now requires cakephp/log as logging is used to emit
  transactional warnings.

  ``after`` annotations to apply its setup/teardown logic.
