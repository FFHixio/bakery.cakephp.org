CakePHP 3.8.0-beta1 Released
============================

The CakePHP team is happy to announce the release of 3.8.0-beta1. This is
preview release for what will become 3.8.0. The 3.8 release series is
a backwards compatible release with the rest of 3.x, it introduces new features
and one additional deprecation.

In the 3.7.0 release announcement I mentioned that we were not planning on doing
a 3.8 release. Based on your feedback about the new ``allowEmpty`` APIs
introduced in 3.7 we are doing an additional release to add the missing
``notEmpty*`` methods and to correct a parameter ordering mistake in the
``allowEmpty*`` methods.

Updating to the beta
--------------------

You can use composer to upgrade to the beta version of CakePHP 3.8.0::

    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:3.8.0-beta1"

We would greatly appreciate it if you temporarily upgraded your application,
and ran your tests. By opening issues for any regressions in the beta, we can
help ensure a smoother release of 3.8.0 before the stable release.

What's new in 3.8.0?
--------------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/3.next/en/appendices/3-8-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 3.8.0. We recommend you give that page a read
when upgrading.
