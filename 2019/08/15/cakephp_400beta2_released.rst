CakePHP 4.0.0-beta2 Released
============================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the first beta release of CakePHP
4.0.0. Since the previous beta we've finished upgrading migrations to 4.x,
cleaned up how booleans and nulls are handled by the database layer, improved
generated javascript snippets, made the development error pages better, finished
migrating all core shells to commands and merged all bugfixes for 3.x in.

The majority of breaking changes for 4.0 are complete. For the next beta release
we'll be focusing on improving stability, improving error messages and plugins
and continuing to add quality of life improvements.

New Features
------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/4.0/en/appendices/4-0-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 4.0.0. We recommend you give that page a read
when upgrading as it notes the various breaking changes present in 4.0.

How you Can Help
----------------

You can help deliver 4.0 by contributing in one of many ways:

#. Check the `documentation <https://book.cakephp.org/4.0/en/>`_ for mistakes,
   outdated, unclear or broken examples. We've been trying to update everything
   but may have not caught everything.
#. Try it out! Give CakePHP 4.0 a test drive in a non-production application.
   We'd love to hear how converting a small application went and what was harder
   than it should have been.
#. File issues for regressions in existing features, or suggest new features.
   While we're not likely to greatly expand the scope of 4.0, we would like
   input on what should be a part of 4.1 and 4.2.
#. Let us know about unclear error messages or silent failures in CakePHP.
